                <div class="ordertwo">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Financial technology has brought a humongous different way to operate finance businesses.
                            This doesn’t mean that traditional banking has vanished.
                            It just means that fintech has customers an alternative to choose from at their convenience.
                            Both traditional banking and technology-led financial services are hellbent on delivering
                            exemplary customer experience with their financial services or financial products.</li>
                        <li>Fintech improves the quality of traditional financial institutions by increasing efficiency
                            and productivity. As banks and credit unions perceive fintech businesses as friends on this
                            road rather than vendors, more opportunities arise.
                            Furthermore, by delivering better and more contemporary services, firms client retention
                            rates are certain to rise, resulting in increased revenues.</li>
                        <li>When you apply for any loan application online., it must be authorized by digital-only
                            lenders that can provide same-day funding, which is only feasible because of Fintech
                            innovation. If you need a short-term loan or a payday loan, then with fintech it gets
                            easier.
                            You can simply discover many lenders online and get access to quick service. Traditional
                            Banks may not have the same advantage and it would take months for them to get it done
                            speedily. Fintech is a smart, efficient, convenient, and speedy way and that's why it is
                            preferred by most businesses.</li>
                        <li>This is an unsaid benefit of fintech technology that it can offer efficiency with all other
                            obvious benefits. Fintech is known for adding efficiency to the process. When you use
                            financial technology,
                            you are already efficient because it provides extremely particular services. Automation
                            doesn’t involve humans and hence automation offers a high level of specialization.
                            As a result, it has a high degree of efficiency and service quality. We as a fintech company
                            can be rapid and agile-both at the same time. Fintech allows you to invest in solutions for
                            a variety of reasons, but the results are specific- improvement in efficiency and time
                            management.</li>
                        <li>Fintech isn't something that is opened by an entrepreneur, it is now universally accepted by
                            everyone who uses it. There are regulatory acts that ensure robust finances, governance,
                            risk management, and compliance skills that
                            reduce risks to the government safety net and possible harm to customers are among the
                            regulatory criteria and expectations for access to FDIC-insured deposits and the banking
                            system.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>5 Reasons Why you Need fintech companies</h3>
                <div class="ordertwo">
                    <ol>
                        <li>The growth of digital technologies has also brought about a rise in payment and remittance
                            solutions.
                            This is a major win for those wanting to stay connected with friends and family overseas and
                            is driving economic growth and creating new opportunities.</li>
                        <li>Fintech space in Nigeria right now. With the rise of fintech, more and more
                            microfinance banks and financial solutions are emerging to serve communities that
                            were previously underserved. This is a major step forward for financial
                            inclusion in Nigeria, and it is helping to provide people with access to
                            essential financial services, capital, and stability.</li>
                        <li>The fintech space in Nigeria is also revolutionizing digital investment and wealth
                            management, making it simpler for people to manage their money and grow their
                            wealth. This is a game-changer for communities looking for stability and a source
                            of capital, and it's driving economic growth and creating new opportunities</li>
                        <li>Traditional banks are slow when it comes to adopting effective,
                            automated security measures. To help prevent fraud and mitigate the risk, financial
                            institutions need to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws which serve a critical
                            role in the Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure. A successful KYC process involves
                            identifying the true identity of the customer as well as the risks they might pose.</li>
                        <li>Fintech plays an important part in today's digital sphere. With Fintech startups spreading
                            like wildfire, you can brace yourself the industry is just getting started.
                            Companies can now expand their services and operate at a much higher efficiency.
                            If you're a business owner, now's the perfect time to think about turning Fintech; into a
                            safer, user-friendly industry with great perspectives.</li>
